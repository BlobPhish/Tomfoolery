### **How to SSH into your VM from your host and upload to github.**
GitHub primarily uses the Git version control system for managing and tracking changes to code repositories. Git is a distributed version control system that was originally developed by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux.

GitHub provides a web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. While Git is the underlying technology, GitHub adds a layer of features and functionality on top of Git. These include web-based repository management, code review tools, issue tracking, project management, and collaboration features.

To interact with GitHub repositories, you typically use Git commands on your local computer, such as git clone, git pull, git push, git commit, and git merge. These commands are part of the Git toolset, and GitHub provides a convenient hosting and collaboration platform for repositories managed with Git.

GitHub also provides an API that developers can use to interact with GitHub programmatically, allowing for automation and integration with other tools and services.

So, while GitHub itself is not a code or programming language, it is a web-based platform that facilitates code collaboration and project management, primarily using Git as the version control system.

### **Getting Started**

**Step 1: Starting SSH Service from your VM**

To start the SSH service on a Linux-based Virtual Machine (VM), you'll need to use a command that's specific to the Linux distribution running on your VM. 
Below are examples for two common Linux distributions: 


Ubuntu (using systemctl) and CentOS/Red Hat (using systemctl). 
Please note that you'll need root or superuser privileges to perform these actions.
