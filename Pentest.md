## Step 1: Identify Your Scope
Ensure you have a clear understanding of the scope of your penetration test. Know which devices, systems, and networks are in scope for testing, and obtain proper authorization if required.

### Target PFSense
192.168.122.47

When the target network was scanned using:

```
nmap -Pn 192.168.122.47 
```

Port 53 and port 80 was shown open indicating:

port 53/tcp is open and the associated service is "domain." Port 53 is commonly used for DNS (Domain Name System) services.

port 80/tcp is open, and the associated service is "http." Port 80 is commonly used for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) web services.

This hinted that there is a webpage associated with the ports that are open. 

I opened Firefox (or whatever web browser) and typed in the IP address. I was directed to the following page:

I used the following dirb tool to perform directory and file scanning on a web server located at the IP address 192.168.122.47. 

```
dirb hittp://192.168.122.47/ | tee dirb_output
```

**dirb:** This is the name of the command or executable that you are running. dirb is a popular web application directory and file brute-forcing tool used for discovering hidden directories and files on web servers.

**http://192.168.122.47/:** This part of the command specifies the target URL where dirb should perform its directory and file scanning. In this case, it's http://192.168.122.47/, which means dirb will scan the web server hosted at the IP address 192.168.122.47.

**|:** The pipe symbol (|) is used to pass the output of one command as input to another command. In this case, it redirects the output of the dirb command to the next command.

**tee:** tee is a command that reads from standard input and writes to standard output and files simultaneously. It is often used to capture command output and save it to a file while still displaying it on the terminal.

**dirb_output:** This is the filename where the output of the dirb command will be saved. In this case, it will create a file named dirb_output in the current directory to store the results of the dirb scan.

The following results are shown:

The results of the scan was entered into the web browser:
![image](https://github.com/BlobPhish/Tomfoolery/assets/144268718/fac8d0d5-78ed-47b4-a365-c286d7c1abc0)

Observe the URL, This yielded nothing of value and the links direct you pictures of cats and minecraft.

However, the second result shows a view.php (Parent directory will take you back the cat main page)

When you click on the link, it will take you to something a little more interesting:

## Step 2: Network Mapping 
Use network scanning tools like Nmap to identify active hosts on the network and discover open ports and services. This information will help you understand the network's topology and potential entry points.
```
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```
